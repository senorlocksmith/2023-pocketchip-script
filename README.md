# 2024-pocketchip-script
A bash script to help quickly setup your pocketchip in 2024

This script is a collection of edits and packages to setup your PocketCHIP to a default install of PocketCHIPs Debian 8 desktop gui install. It also edits the sources.list and preferences file so you can update and install packages. 

This is a work in progress. Try at your own risk. I am not responsible for bricking or corrupting your CHIP or PocketCHIP.
